\section{Expected Results}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Catalogue of challenges that arise when adapting centralised NAS methods to FL.
	\item An overview of FL system parameters that influence the relevance of a challenge.
	\item A catalogue of adaptation techniques extracted from FedNAS methods with an in-depth discussion of the challenges they overcome.
	\item An overview of adaptation techniques that developers can use to see which adaptation challenges overcome which challenges to what extent at a glance.
\end{enumerate}

% The expected results may vary depending on the topic. As a rule, these will be descriptions of specific products of scientific work. These include, for example, criteria catalogs, evaluation reports, software programs, survey results, models, descriptions of methods/procedures, bibliographies, etc. Initial hypotheses about the expected results of the study can also be outlined.
