\section{Expected Results}

We expect to produce the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A consolidated catalogue of challenges that arise when adapting centralised NAS methods to FL.
	\item Classification of the influence of FL system characteristics on the relevance of a challenge.
	\item A catalogue of adaptation techniques extracted from FedNAS methods with an in-depth discussion of the challenges they overcome.
	\item A tabular overview of adaptation techniques that shows which challenges they overcome at a glance.
\end{enumerate}
