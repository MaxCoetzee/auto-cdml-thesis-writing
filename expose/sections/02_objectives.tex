\section{Objectives}\label{sec:objectives}

% TODO: how are objectives and expected results  different?
The primary objective of this thesis is to provide an overview of techniques used to adapt centralised NAS to FL, spawning the following sub-objectives: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Catalogue the assumptions that hold for centralised NAS, but are violated in FedNAS and to what extent these assumptions are violated based on FL system parameters.
    \item Describe the challenges arising from the mismatch in assumptions between centralised NAS and FedNAS.
    \item Catalogue the adaptation techniques used to overcome these challenges.
\end{enumerate}
