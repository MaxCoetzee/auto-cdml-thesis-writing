\section{Objectives}\label{sec:objectives}

% As part of the objectives, it must be made clear what the work is intended to achieve. The achievement of the main objective is the most important basis for the subsequent assessment of the work. Sub-objectives can be derived from this main objective, which represent necessary partial achievements to reach the main objective. The objective must be clearly described and verifiable. It should be possible to formulate the objectives in the form of specific questions. Subsequent changes to the objective may be made in consultation with the supervisor.

The primary objective of this thesis is to provide an overview of techniques used to adapt centralised NAS to FL, spawning the following sub-objectives: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify FL system parameters relevant for adapting a centralised NAS method to FL. 
    \item Catalogue the assumptions that hold for centralised NAS, but are violated in FedNAS and to what extent these assumptions are violated based on FL system parameters.
    \item Describe the challenges arising from the mismatch in assumptions between centralised NAS and FedNAS.
    \item Catalogue the adaptation techniques used to overcome these challenges.
\end{enumerate}
