\section{Problem Statement}

% First, the reason for the research project must be described. Considering the research cycle and using the cycle as a structure for your argumentation can help. The reason may, for example, lie in a lack of knowledge on an issue, an area or a theory in research or a problem that can be observed in practice. It must be made clear why the scientific study of the topic is considered relevant at all. The research problem to be solved in the thesis must be defined on the basis of a precisely formulated practical problem. The current state of research should also be identified. Which comparable research projects have already been carried out and what are the results? What is the status in the scientific literature and, if applicable, in practice?

\input{../chapters/01_introduction/02_main_content}

\section{Objectives}

- organise FedNAS literature in a way such FedNAS developers can easily re-use techniques

% As part of the objectives, it must be made clear what the work is intended to achieve. The achievement of the main objective is the most important basis for the subsequent assessment of the work. Sub-objectives can be derived from this main objective, which represent necessary partial achievements to reach the main objective. The objective must be clearly described and verifiable. It should be possible to formulate the objectives in the form of specific questions. Subsequent changes to the objective may be made in consultation with the supervisor.

\section{Explanation of Terms}

- adaptation techniques
- NAS
- FL
- FL setting

% At this point, a definition of the central terms - in particular the terms that appear in the planned title of the academic paper - must be provided. Sources that were used to define the terms must be cited. Any deviations from existing definitions must be justified.

\section{Research Approach}\label{sec:research_approach}

- qualitative

% The approach describes the research method with which the objectives of the work are to be achieved. This will vary greatly depending on the type of work (qualitative or quantitative work, etc.). The description of the approach should at least contain information on data collection and data analysis.

\section{Structure}

% Please provide a first outline of your thesis. The number of sections in a chapter and the level of detail should correspond to the importance of the sections. A 1st and 2nd level outline are sufficient for the proposal. The outline must be annotated. This means that the content and aim of each chapter must be described in the form of questions. The estimated number of pages per section must be added to the comments. Example: 1. Introduction (2 pages) 1.1 Problem definition (1 page) || Comment... ..

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Introduction} (3 pages)
    
    \item \textbf{Background} (6 pages)
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Neural Architecture Search 
        \item Federated Learning
        \item Federated Neural Architecture Search 
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item \textbf{Method} (5 pages)
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Method and Literature Selection
        \item Reviewed Literature
    \end{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{FedNAS Challenges} (10 pages): 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Parameters of FL settings relevant to FedNAS
        \item Assumption Discrepancies between NAS and FedNAS
        \item FedNAS Challenges
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item \textbf{Adaptation Techniques} (25 pages)
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Adaptation Technique 1
        \item Adaptation Technique 2 
        \item ...
        \item Adaptation Technique 20
        \item Overview 
    \end{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Discussion} (2 pages)

    \item \textbf{Conclusion} (1 page)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Expected Results}

% The expected results may vary depending on the topic. As a rule, these will be descriptions of specific products of scientific work. These include, for example, criteria catalogs, evaluation reports, software programs, survey results, models, descriptions of methods/procedures, bibliographies, etc. Initial hypotheses about the expected results of the study can also be outlined.

\section{Open Issues and Problems}

% If any questions or uncertainties arise while working on the proposal, these can be noted and described in this chapter. These questions should be clarified with the supervisor and, if necessary, presented in the interim presentation

- finding the correct abstraction level for adaptation techniques
