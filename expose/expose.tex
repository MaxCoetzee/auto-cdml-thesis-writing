\section{Problem Statement}

% First, the reason for the research project must be described. Considering the research cycle and using the cycle as a structure for your argumentation can help. The reason may, for example, lie in a lack of knowledge on an issue, an area or a theory in research or a problem that can be observed in practice. It must be made clear why the scientific study of the topic is considered relevant at all. The research problem to be solved in the thesis must be defined on the basis of a precisely formulated practical problem. The current state of research should also be identified. Which comparable research projects have already been carried out and what are the results? What is the status in the scientific literature and, if applicable, in practice?

\input{../chapters/01_introduction/02_main_content}

\section{Objectives}

% As part of the objectives, it must be made clear what the work is intended to achieve. The achievement of the main objective is the most important basis for the subsequent assessment of the work. Sub-objectives can be derived from this main objective, which represent necessary partial achievements to reach the main objective. The objective must be clearly described and verifiable. It should be possible to formulate the objectives in the form of specific questions. Subsequent changes to the objective may be made in consultation with the supervisor.

What is the work intended to achieve? Make it easier to incorporate existing adaptation techniques into newly designed FedNAS methods. 

Test for achievement of objective: How long does it take to design a FedNAS method with and without the overview of this thesis.
- generate knowledge that is useful for creating new FedNAS methods
- 
- organise FedNAS literature in a way such FedNAS developers can easily re-use techniques

The primary objective of this thesis is to support the design of new FedNAS methods by providing a structured overview of (i) challenges that arise when applying Neural Architecture Search (NAS) in different Federated Learning (FL) settings and (ii) adaptation techniques proposed in the literature to address these challenges.

From this primary objective, the following sub-objectives are derived (cf. the objective decomposition style in the example exposé:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Derive a characterization of FL settings relevant to FedNAS:} Define a set of FL setting parameters that are reported in the FedNAS literature or can be inferred from experimental setups and that plausibly influence which NAS assumptions are violated.
    
    \item \textbf{Identify assumption discrepancies and resulting challenges:} Systematically identify which assumptions of centralised NAS methods are violated under which FL setting parameters and derive a catalogue of FedNAS challenges grounded in the reviewed papers.

    \item \textbf{Extract and conceptualize adaptation techniques:} Extract technique candidates from FedNAS papers and iteratively refine them into a coherent set of adaptation techniques that is mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive at the chosen abstraction level.

    \item \textbf{Relate techniques to challenges:}
    Analyse how each adaptation technique addresses, aggravates, or does not affect each challenge, and identify trade-offs reported or implied in the literature.

    \item \textbf{Provide practitioner-oriented artefacts:}
    Produce (a) an overview table mapping \emph{FedNAS methods} to the challenges they address via their techniques and (b) an overview table mapping \emph{adaptation techniques} to challenge effects to support technique selection and method design.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Verifiability / success criteria.}
The objective is considered achieved if the resulting artefacts (i) cover all included FedNAS methods, (ii) allow each included method to be decomposed into a set of adaptation techniques, and (iii) provide an explicit, traceable mapping from techniques to challenges (with paper references) such that a reader can justify reuse decisions without re-reviewing the full literature corpus.

\section{Explanation of Terms}

% At this point, a definition of the central terms - in particular the terms that appear in the planned title of the academic paper - must be provided. Sources that were used to define the terms must be cited. Any deviations from existing definitions must be justified.

\textbf{Neural Architecture Search (NAS)}

Traditionally, neural network architectures are designed by a team of domain and DL experts. In NAS, the architecture is automatically determined refers to the automated process of  neural network architectures that achieve high performance for a given task, dataset, and constraints. A NAS method is commonly described by its search space, search strategy, and performance estimation strategy.

%~\cite{nas_survey_2019}
%~\cite{nas_1000_papers}


\textbf{Federated Learning}
FL is a distributed learning paradigm in which multiple clients collaboratively train a model under the coordination of a server while keeping training data local to the clients (see also the FL definition used in the Problem Statement).
%~\cite{fl_seminal_2017}

\textbf{FL setting and FL setting parameters}
An \emph{FL setting} denotes the concrete environment in which FL (and here: FedNAS) is executed (e.g., cross-device vs.\ cross-silo, number of clients, client availability, hardware heterogeneity, bandwidth constraints, degree of non-IID data). \emph{FL setting parameters} are the specific attributes used to describe and compare such settings in a reproducible manner. In this thesis, the parameter set is derived from recurring variations observed in the FedNAS literature.

% TODO: cite papers used for table

\textbf{Federated Neural Architecture Search (FedNAS) method}
A FedNAS method is a NAS method that is designed to operate in an FL setting, i.e., it searches for architectures while respecting FL constraints such as decentralised data and communication limits.

\textbf{FedNAS challenge}
A FedNAS challenge is a concrete problem that arises when assumption discrepancies prevent directly applying a centralised NAS method in an FL setting (e.g., excessive client-side compute demand, communication overhead, unstable search dynamics under partial participation).

\textbf{Adaptation technique} An adaptation technique is any modification to a NAS method that is explicitly motivated by the FL setting (or by a FedNAS challenge) and is intended to make the search feasible, efficient, or effective in that setting. This thesis conceptualises adaptation techniques at a level where they can be reused as design building blocks across methods.


\section{Research Approach}
- How is the data collected?
We take a qualitiative research approach in the style of the CDML paper.

- qualitative
- iterative conceptualisation

% The approach describes the research method with which the objectives of the work are to be achieved. This will vary greatly depending on the type of work (qualitative or quantitative work, etc.). The description of the approach should at least contain information on data collection and data analysis.

The thesis follows a qualitative, iterative research approach in the form of a systematic literature review combined with grounded-theory-inspired coding. The goal is to derive a conceptual model that links FL setting parameters, violated NAS assumptions, resulting challenges, and adaptation techniques.

\subsection{Data Collection (Literature Selection)}
We collect and select papers that propose or evaluate FedNAS methods. The inclusion and exclusion procedure follows a structured screening process inspired by PRISMA-style selection reporting (identification, screening, eligibility, inclusion). The final corpus consists of FedNAS papers that include one or more explicit adaptations of NAS to an FL setting.

\textbf{Inclusion criteria (examples).}
A paper is included if it (i) proposes a method that performs architecture search in an FL setting or (ii) presents a substantive modification of a NAS method specifically motivated by FL constraints.

\textbf{Exclusion criteria (examples).}
A paper is excluded if it (i) performs only hyperparameter optimisation without architecture search, (ii) applies a fixed architecture in FL without searching, or (iii) does not provide sufficient methodological detail to extract adaptations.

\textbf{Data Analysis (Coding and Conceptualisation)}
The analysis proceeds in iterative steps (open and axial coding), aligned with the staged and explicit structure exemplified in the attached proposal:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{FL setting characterisation:}
    For each FedNAS method, extract reported FL setting parameters. If parameters are not stated, infer them conservatively from the experimental setup and clearly mark them as inferred.

    \item \textbf{Challenge derivation via assumption discrepancies:}
    Identify which centralised NAS assumptions do not hold under the extracted setting parameters and code the resulting challenges. Challenges are refined iteratively until they form a stable catalogue.

    \item \textbf{Unrefined adaptation technique extraction (open coding):}
    Extract technique candidates as any modification explicitly motivated by the FL setting or by a FedNAS challenge.

    \item \textbf{Adaptation technique conceptualisation (axial coding):}
    Merge and refine technique candidates into adaptation techniques based on mechanism similarity. The goal is a coherent set of techniques at a reusable abstraction level.

    \item \textbf{Technique--challenge mapping (axial coding):}
    For each technique, code its effect on each challenge as \emph{mitigates}, \emph{aggravates}, or \emph{no clear effect}. Where the literature is ambiguous, the coding records uncertainty explicitly.

    \item \textbf{Synthesis into artefacts:}
    Produce (i) a taxonomy of adaptation techniques, (ii) a method-to-challenges overview derived from each method's techniques, and (iii) a technique-to-challenges overview to support design decisions.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Traceability and rigor.}
To ensure transparency, the thesis maintains an audit trail that links each coded technique, challenge, and setting parameter to supporting passages in the source papers. Where interpretations are required (e.g., inferred setting parameters), the thesis distinguishes clearly between reported and inferred information, reflecting the writing guideline that clear communication is the goal.
