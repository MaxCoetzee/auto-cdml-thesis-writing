\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Literature Selection:} We follow the guidelines and flow diagrams provided by PRISMA 2020 \cite{prisma_2020} for inclusion and exclusion of papers and perform forward and backwards citation searching. Each paper contains one or more FedNAS methods. 
    \item \textbf{Adaptation Technique Extraction:} Once the set of included papers is fixed, we analyse each paper individually, extracting the adaptation techniques it uses and summarising them.
    % how to measure conceptual similarity?
    \item \textbf{Merge Highly-Similar Adaptation Techniques:} We then merge conceptually highly-similar adaptation techniques into a single representative adaptation technique.
    \item \textbf{Categorise Adaptation Techniques:} After merging, we categorise the adaptation techniques based on conceptual similarity and deliver a taxonomy of adaptation techniques.
    \item \textbf{Map FL Challenge Types onto Adaptation Techniques:} Next, we discuss how each adaptation technique works towards, against, or does not affect overcoming each of the FL challenge classes and provide a table with an overview as an end result.
