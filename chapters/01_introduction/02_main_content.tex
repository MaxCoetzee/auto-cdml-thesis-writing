% NAS explanation and why it is important
In the wake of the deep learning revolution, deep learning is being applied to perform an increasingly diverse set of tasks. Applying deep learning traditionally involves a team of deep learning and domain experts tailoring the neural network architecture towards the task at hand via a lengthy process of trial and error. To automate this process, researchers invented \textit{Neural Architecture Search} (NAS)~\cite{nas_survey_2019} methods and improved them over the past decade. NAS methods employ diverse strategies to automatically search for a neural network architecture for a given deep learning task — typically by iteratively evaluating the performance of a set of candidate architectures and selecting the best ones [TODO: confirm].

% FL explanation and why it is important
Independently, but in parallel to NAS, researchers developed a machine learning approach called \textit{Federated Learning} (FL)~\cite{fl_seminal_2017} which enables training a ML model on data that is distributed across a set of \textit{clients} and enhances the privacy of that data. Training in FL is coordinated by a \textit{server} that aggregates model updates computed by the clients locally into a globally shared model. 

% why NAS for FL is useful: NAS can deal with client data heterogenity 
Practitioners\footnote{In this thesis, \textit{practitioners} refers to both users and developers of FL and FedNAS methods.} making use of deep learning in FL typically [TODO: reconciliate with supervisor comment] select a neural network architecture upfront — a so-called \textit{predefined architecture}. However, because practitioners can not see clients' data and the data distributions vary significantly in FL [TODO: contrast with typical ML to show why this is a problem?], they may select an architecture which does not generalise well on some of the client data distributions. This leads to a slow, unstable training process and [TODO: only makes this difficult] likely results in a model with low accuracy and, on less powerful clients [TODO: because of the one size fits all approach], results in high inference latency. Practitioners have started using NAS methods instead of predefined architectures in FL to mitigate these issues. NAS methods can search for architectures suited to the clients' data guided by performance feedback from candidate architectures trained on clients. As a result, the searched architecture can potentially speed up training convergence~\cite{fed_meta_nas_2025}, make training more stable~\cite{hapfnas_2025}, increase the accuracy of the globally aggregated model~\cite{fednas_2021} and reduce the trained model's inference latency~\cite{decnas_2022} — all depending on the optimisation objectives and constraints of the NAS method.

% overall problem in "adapting NAS to FL" domain
Despite the benefits, using NAS in FL is not straightforward. Most NAS methods were not developed for FL and need to be modified for the FL setting, because many assumptions that hold for the search process in typical, centralised NAS do not hold for NAS in FL. These assumption discrepancies result in \textit{challenges} for using centralised NAS methods in FL, and practitioners have created \textit{adaptation techniques} for overcoming them. [TODO: reword clients vs. worker nodes clarity] For example, centralised NAS can assume worker nodes are connected via low-latency, high-bandwidth links, but clients in FL are not. [TODO: more concise, less convoluted] This poses a problem for using unmodified supernet-based NAS methods in particular, since the server would need to transfer the updated weights of the entire supernet to each client after aggregation, which would take so long as to make it unworkable in practice. One adaptation technique overcomes this challenge by only sending a randomly sampled subspace of the supernet such that the size of the sent weights fits within a budget that can realistically be expected to take a short amount of time to transfer over the network.

% the relevant challenge subset depends on the targeted FL setting, which varies a lot
The relevant subset of challenges faced by these kinds of FedNAS methods depends on the configuration of FL system parameters~\cite{fl_advances_and_open_problems_2021}. System parameters include the average hardware capabilities of clients, the average network latency of clients, the number of participating clients, etc. For example, in the so-called \textit{cross-silo setting}, clients can be expected to be equipped with GPUs, making challenges caused by low-end hardware in FL less relevant.

% practical problem: hard to make design decisions based on current literature
Practitioners adapting a centralised NAS method to FL with a specific set of FL system parameters in mind must decide which challenges to prioritise and which adaptation techniques to implement. However, the literature does not offer clear guidance for these design decisions. The incurred challenges are scattered throughout the literature, the adaptation techniques used to address them are often not presented in isolation, and a large portion of the FedNAS literature does not clearly state the targeted FL system parameters. As a result, practitioners struggle to assess the usefulness of existing adaptation techniques for their targeted FL system parameters and risk selecting ineffective techniques or selecting techniques for addressing a challenge that are known to worsen another.

% # Gap
% ## "Situate in research: What are the conclusions of existing literature for that problem / situation in this domain?"
% ## "What is the problem or issue with that existing literature?" (practical problem)
Prior literature surveys~\cite{fl_to_nas_survey_2021}~\cite{nas_hpo_fl_survey_2023}~\cite{multi-objective_methods_in_fl_2025} only summarise FedNAS methods on the whole and do not focus on isolated, re-usable adaptation techniques. Additionally, prior surveys are limited by the FedNAS methods available at the time or exclude a large share of the FedNAS literature due to their chosen focus. As a result, prior surveys do not provide an exhaustive overview of adaptation techniques and do not help practitioners assess the usefulness of existing adaptation techniques for their targeted FL system parameters. Since prior surveys do not solve the problem mentioned in the previous paragraph, we pose the following research question to help with the adaptation of NAS methods to FL:

\vspace{1em}
% TODO: unsatisfactory and long
\textbf{What challenges arise when adapting centralised NAS methods to FL? How is the relevance of challenges influenced by FL system parameters, and how do adaptation techniques in the literature overcome these challenges?}
\vspace{1em}

% # "Study: How investigate? Process, context & why?"
% ## "Indicate that this study addresses that problem or issue and state how."
% ## "Describe the study, sample, and method for addressing that problem or issue."
To tackle our research question, we conduct a systematic literature review of literature that presents FedNAS methods which modify centralised NAS methods in response to the FL setting.

% ### from targeted FL settings and their challenges to adaptation techniques
We conduct a literature search using Scopus~\cite{scopus} to collect relevant publications. We include FedNAS literature that explicitly modifies a centralised NAS method for FL, and exclude FedNAS methods built from scratch, concern only hyperparameter optimisation, or methods with insufficient detail. We then recursively add eligible literature from references.

We extract adaptation techniques through open coding and iteratively refine them afterwards. We map each technique's effect onto each challenge and summarise results in a challenge-technique table for practitioners.

% # "Conclusion"
% ## "Describe what you found. State explicitly how these findings extend and contribute to existing knowledge."
Our review aims to support the adaptation of centralised NAS methods to FL. To this end, we make the following contributions. By providing an overview of the challenges arising from discrepancies in assumptions between centralised NAS and FedNAS, we make explicit what troubles practitioners can expect to run into based on past experiences. [TODO: connect with previous sentence] By describing how FL system parameters influence the relevance of challenges, we enable practitioners to focus on the challenges relevant to their targeted FL system parameters. [TODO: connect with previous sentence] By extracting adaptation techniques and highlighting the challenges they address, we enable practitioners to reuse existing adaptation techniques for adapting centralised NAS methods to FL for their specific set of challenges.
