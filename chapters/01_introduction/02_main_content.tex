% NAS explanation and why it is important
Engineering the architecture of a neural network for a Deep Learning application is traditionally done by a team of domain experts and Deep Learning experts based on their expert knowledge and a process of trial and error. To reduce the amount of manual labour involved in this process, researchers invented \textit{Neural Architecture Search} (NAS)~\cite{nas_survey_2019} methods and improved them over the past decade. NAS methods employ diverse strategies to automatically search for a neural network architecture for a given Deep Learning application.

% FL explanation and why it is important
Independantly, but in parallel to NAS, researchers developed a distributed machine learning approach called \textit{Federated Learning} (FL)~\cite{fl_seminal_2017} in response to growing concerns about data privacy. In FL, \textit{clients} collaboratively train a model without sharing their local data. This enhances the privacy of clients' data, because model trainers can not view clients' data and client data is not collected at a central location where a single breach could expose the data of all clients. % TODO: use cases

% why NAS for FL is important: predefined architectures do not work well in FL 
Engineering neural network architectures in FL is as time-consuming (if not more so) % TODO: cite time it takes to engineer
as in centralised Deep Learning, therefore researchers have started investigating the use of NAS methods in FL~\cite{fednas_2021}~\cite{fedoras_2022}~\cite{finch_2024}. Additionally, NAS methods provide an alternative to selecting a fixed architecture upfront — a so-called \textit{prededfined architecture}. Predefined architectures can lead to slow training convergence and poorly performing models in FL, because model developers can view neither the clients' data nor, typically, client's hardware capabilities. Model developers may therefore select a predefined architecture that contains components irrelevant for generalising well from client data sets or select an architecture that trains slowly on some clients. Work has already been done that shows the use of NAS methods in FL can mitigate these issues~\cite{fedpnas_2021}~\cite{spider_2021}~\cite{peaches_2024}.

% hook b) "What is the overall problem or situation in that domain?"
% overall problem in FedNAS domain: assumption discrepancies create challenges for using NAS in FL
Despite the potential advantages of using NAS in FL, it is still non-trivial to do so. Most NAS methods are infeasible for direct application in FL, because NAS research has focused on the traditional centralised setting as opposed to FL. Centralised NAS can make several assumptions about the search process that do not hold in the FL setting. Each assumption discrepancy creates a \textit{challenge} for using NAS in FL, and developers have created \textit{adaptation techniques} for overcoming them. Applying adaptation techniques to NAS methods results in \textit{Federated Neural Architecture Search methods} (FedNAS methods)~\cite{fednas_2021}.

% challenge example: limited computational resources per client
For example, one challenge arises from the fact that centralised NAS can assume worker nodes are computationally powerful, whereas clients in most FL settings are not. Since most centralised NAS methods place large computational burdens on worker nodes, practitioners using these NAS methods in FL without modification would experience detrimental search completion times. To combat this, FedNAS developers have created adaptation techniques to reduce the computational burden on individual clients in FedNAS methods~\cite{fedoras_2022}~\cite{efnas_2024}~\cite{nasfly_2024}. This typically involves reducing the overall computational work and splitting it up into smaller units, which presents a challenge, as the implementation of the resulting FedNAS method tends to be complex.

% the relevant challenge subset depends on the targeted FL setting, which varies a lotg
The subset of challenges faced by FedNAS methods depends on the specific FL setting, which can differ in many parameters~\cite{fl_advances_and_open_problems_2021}. The literature identifies two major classes of FL settings: the \textit{cross-device} class, wherein clients are edge devices, and the \textit{cross-silo} class, wherein clients are entire organisations, but even within these classes, there is significant variation in the setting parameters. Each FL setting violates centralised NAS assumptions to a different extent, making some challenges more relevant to them than others. For example, for FL settings in the cross-silo class, clients can be expected to be equipped with GPUs, making the challenge described above less relevant.

% TODO: clearly formulate practical problem
% concrete actor, concrete task, concrete problems that arise
% Design decision support problem

% practical problem
FedNAS developers who design new FedNAS methods for a specific FL setting must decide which challenges to prioritise and which adaptation techniques to implement for their chosen NAS method. % TODO: not all FedNAS methods are based on centralised NAS methods
However, informing these design decisions currently requires extensive, manual synthesis of a fragmented literature, because many FedNAS papers do not state the targeted FL setting parameters and assumptions clearly, nor do they clearly link techniques with the addressed challenges. As a result, developers struggle to assess the transferability of existing methods to their setting and risk selecting ineffective or select techniques for addressing a challenge that are known to worsen another. This slows down the development of new FedNAS methods.

% # Gap
% ## "Situate in research: What are the conclusions of existing literature for that problem / situation in this domain?"
% ## "What is the problem or issue with that existing literature?" (practical problem)
The literature on adaptation techniques is fragmented, and FedNAS methods often lack clarity regarding the targeted FL setting and the challenges they address. As a result, extending and re-using existing techniques remains difficult. This poses a problem for FedNAS developers, since they need to trade off which challenges to address for their targeted FL setting without a clear overview of adaptation techniques that would be useful for that setting. Prior literature surveys~\cite{fl_to_nas_survey_2021}~\cite{nas_hpo_fl_survey_2023}~\cite{multi-objective_methods_in_fl_2025} summarise FedNAS methods on the whole, but do not dissect them in a manner that allows FedNAS developers to decide on the parts they wish to re-use. To aid the development of new FedNAS methods, we set out to answer our research question:

\vspace{1em}
\textbf{What challenges arise from different FL settings for FedNAS methods, and which adaptation techniques address them in the literature?}
\vspace{1em}

% # "Study: How investigate? Process, context & why?"
% ## "Indicate that this study addresses that problem or issue and state how."
% ## "Describe the study, sample, and method for addressing that problem or issue."
To tackle our research question, we conduct a systematic literature review of papers that present FedNAS methods. We employ grounded theory and the methodology from \cite{cdml_2024}. For our review, we consider papers that modify NAS methods in response to the FL setting.

% ### from targeted FL settings and their challenges to adaptation techniques
We define a set of fine-grained parameters to characterise the targeted FL setting of each FedNAS method based on observations of varying setting parameters in the literature. With the help of this characterisation, we identify the violated centralised NAS assumptions and catalogue the challenges that arise from them. Next, we extract unrefined adaptation techniques from the FedNAS methods and iteratively refine and merge them to obtain a set of collectively exhaustive adaptation techniques. We analyse how each adaptation technique works towards, against, or does not affect each challenge, and present our findings in the form of a discussion for each adaptation technique, as well as an overview table. 

% # "Conclusion"
% ## "Describe what you found. State explicitly how these findings extend and contribute to existing knowledge."
% - first sentence: what is the main goal
% - following sentences: contributions to knowledge and why they are relevant to research question
Our review aims to support the creation of new FedNAS methods by developers. By identifying the source of challenges and elaborating on them, we provide clarity on the expected challenges for a targeted FL setting. Based on the expected challenges, FedNAS developers can use our overview of adaptation techniques to guide the design of new FedNAS methods and determine whether to re-use existing techniques, extend them, or develop new ones.
